Fake News Detection System

A Machine Learning-based web application that detects whether a news article is Real or Fake using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

📌 Project Overview

Fake news has become a major issue in the digital world. This project aims to build an intelligent system that analyzes news content and predicts its authenticity using machine learning algorithms.

The model is trained on labeled news datasets and classifies input text as:

✅ Real News

❌ Fake News
